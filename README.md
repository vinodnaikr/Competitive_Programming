# 💻 Multilingual Competitive Programming & OOP

This repository houses my solutions and practice across Python, C++, and C, focusing on Object-Oriented Programming and efficient algorithm design.

## 🛠️ Languages & Tools
- **Python**: Advanced OOP, File I/O, and Scripting.
- **C++**: Fundamental syntax, memory-efficient data types (Unions/Enums), and debugging.
- **C**: Basic programming constructs and low-level logic.
- **IDE**: VS Code (Python/C++) & Dev-C++.
- **Version Control**: Git 2.53.0.

## 📁 Repository Structure

### 🐍 Python (OOP & Projects)
- **Vectors**: Operator overloading for n-dimensional math.
- **Projects**: [The Perfect Guess](./Vs_Code_Practice/project2.py) game.

### 🔵 C++ / C (Placement Prep)
- **Foundations**: Practice files for basic syntax and data structures.
- **Debugging**: Solutions resolved while practicing in Dev-C++.
